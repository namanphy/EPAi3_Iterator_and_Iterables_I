# Polygons

It is a class present in Assignment8.py this class will take two input one radius and another side. and form polygons according to this.

## len

This is the function inside the `Polygons` class it will return length.

## iter

This is the function inside the `Polygons` class it will return ifself and make it iterator

## PolygonsIterator

This is the sub class inside the `Polygons` class. It will make the `Polygons` class an iterator. It returns itself when `__iter__`
is called. It returns the elements one by one whenever `__next__` is called until the `StopIteration` exception occurs which means
itertor is exhausted.
